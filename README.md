# QP-solver-benchmarks-on-MPC

### This is a course project of MPC course instructed MPC expert, Prof. Ilya Kolmanovsky in University of Michigan
### The benchmarks includes QP solvers: Fast Interior Point Method(FIP), Proximally Stabilized FB Method (FBstab), Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers(ADMM),
Gradient Projection Method (GPD), and Accelerated Gradient Projection Method (GPAD).
### The implemetation is to stablize the satellite linear system (6*6 state space model) with constraints, which is a typical MPC problem. 
### More detials and conclusions shows in pdf report.
